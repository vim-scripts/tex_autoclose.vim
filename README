Provides mappings to automatically close environments.

Pressing "\c" in normal mode (or <C-\>c in insert mode) will cause the last open environment to be closed. (If a fold is started on the \begin{env} line, then it will be automatically closed on the \close{env} line.)

Also pressing "<C-\>}" in insert mode when the cursor is at the end of a "\begin{environment}" will automatically generate a "\close{environment}". It will leave the cursor at the end of the "\begin{environment}" (in insert mode), so that the user can enter arguments [if any].

Small and functional. Suggestions welcome.
